# Project WALL-E

## Dev Setup
Upon first cloning the repo, install `pre-commit` on your system (i.e on Ubuntu `sudo apt install pre-commit`) and run `pre-commit` in the root Git directory to initialise the git hooks we'll be using on this project.

I recommend using `commitizen` too (`pip install commitizen`) for better commits (then make git commits via `cz commit`).
